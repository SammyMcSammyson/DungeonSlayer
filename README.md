---04/10/2024 1635--- Have a plan in my head and got an indea for how everything works. Also going to attept to stretch myself by adding a story using conditional rendering - also media queries are important since I work on a big screen and my mates test my projects on their phone.

---05/10/2024 1720 --- Spent a few hours on this - I understand what Manny said about having different components and I know that in the future it will make life easier but for this project and my lack of skills passing data between components took 95% of my time to work out and only really got solved when I put the code into Chatg GPT to ask about my error - it was between child and grandchild component and I get what I did wrong but I would of never worked it out myselg. However I learnt alot about passing values and if you asked me to do it again it would be alot simplier to complete and I would be able to make it more complicated. I have a base game which works and have used media queires which means it works on phones - my mate said he enjoyed the alerts. I have some CSS to do and I want to add a seperate shop on another page...

---06/10/2024 2000 --- Fixed a few things and have been messing around with media queires I think I am 80% of the way there to make it completely polish but you can play the game and it works. I want to add some death screens and some other QoL updates. Will do in my own time. Overall I am happy with it.

---07/10/2024 2247--- Changed some UI features and helped improve the gameplay mechanics so you do not randomly die added features to make the Gold per Second more nuanced. Added the Adventurers Guild. The plan for that is it opens up another Questline which has more branches for the story and includes influence. The choice for the adventure in the story will be Pay a fee and get a new shop item or pay a bigger fee and gain influence. As they go down the branch they can then use their influence in the story for diffrent outcomes. Depending on certain conditions with items in the shop and how much influence they will get 4 differnt story ends and depending on the story end they will unlock 1 of 4 possible stories.

---08/10/2024 2044--- Changed some UI feature but added the Adventure Guild I also added some dummy data. I can change later - The next goal is when the Adventur Guild Is unlocked it reloads a new shop and soft resets the player - aka Prestiege. Also going to work on the influence dynamic.
